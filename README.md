# Uppsala Armed Conflict Data


### **About the The Uppsala Conflict Data Program** 

The data used in this project has been collected by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) of the Department of Peace and Conflict Research of Uppsala University in Sweden and the International Peace Research Institute (PRIO) in Oslo. Established in 1946, the UCDP is an extensive public data collection project focused on global armed conflict. The project collects qualitative and quantitative data (e.g. violence type, conflict description, actors involved, geo-references, etc..) on different types of conflcits involving organized actors with armed force. UCDP defines organized actors as governments of independent states, formally organized groups or informally organized groups. Armed force refers to the use of any material means to promote the actorâ€™s position in the conflict which results in deaths. The data program is directed by Associate Professor Kristine Eck of Uppsala University and a team of approximately 15 researchers. The project has grown to become one of the main providers of data on global organized violence and armed conflict. 


### **Overview of Armed Conflict**

According to Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross, armed conflicts are defined as either international (involving states only) or non-international (between governmental or non-governmental groups). All armed conflicts are governed by international humanitarian law (IHL), also known as the laws of war, which regulates the conduct of war. International humanitarian law controls the effects of armed conflict by protecting civilians and restricting the tools of warfare available to combatants. IHL is codified in various treaties and customs such as the Geneva Conventions. States which have ratified these treaties are bound by international humanitarian law. Populations and physical spaces affected by armed conflict face significant impacts. Physical impacts include damage to infrastructure, disruption of economic markets and environmental degradation while population impacts include displacement, lack of access to health services, malnutrition and human rights violations. Various groups are working to help populations impacted by armed violence and victims of war across the globe. These groups include the International Committee of the Red Cross, UNICEF, Amnesty International, Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee and Save the Children. 

### **Overview of the Project**

The Armed Conflict Exploratory Dashboard consists of an interactive map and visual representations of armed conflict 
data post-Cold War up to 2017. These visualizations represent trends over time and key summary statistics. The term armed conflict refers to any act of organized violence between two actors that involved at least one fatality. The dataset contains information on 142,902 incidents of armed conflict between the years 1989 and 2017. Each event in the dataset contains information on: the geographic location of the conflict, the actors involved, the type of violence displayed and various estimations of the number of casualties incurred. 

### **Overview of the Repository**

* The Data folder contains the raw datasets (in csv format) and the RDS files used to create the app. 
* The PDF file named "codebook" is the codebook referring to the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset. 
* The Initial App folder contains the Shiny Web App document and supporting RDS files required to build the app.
