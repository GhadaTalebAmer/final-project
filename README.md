Overview of the Project

The Armed Conflict Exploratory Dashboard consists of an interactive map and visual representations of armed conflict 
data post-Cold War up to 2017. The data used in this project has been collected by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)
of the Department of Peace and Conflict Research and the International Peace Research Institute (PRIO) in Oslo.
The dataset contains information on 142,902 incidents of armed conflict between the years 1989 and 2017. 
The term armed conflict refers to any act of organized violence between two actors that involved at least one fatality.
Each event in the dataset contains information on: the geographic location of the conflict,
the actors involved, the type of violence displayed and various estimations of the number of casualties involved

Significance and Purpose of the Project

The rationale for the project created here is an academic exploration of armed conflicts
around the world. By taking a historical perspective on conflict, those interested in the topic
can understand global trends in violence and how these trends play out regionally. With a 
contemporary increase in non-state actors such as militias and armed resistance groups, it is
important to study the emergence of such groups and map their activities globally. By breaking down
the visualizations of the data into categories of violence, one can also get a better understanding 
of aggressor states that are involved in one-sided violence against their people.

Summary of Main Findings

The basic unit of analysis here is an armed conflict event. Between 1989 and 2017, approximately
143,000 distinct events occured across the world (excluding Syria). In all these events,
the cumulative death toll of all fatalities was approximately 2,022,000 with the most deaths concentrated in 
continental Africa. Continental Asia recorded the second highest death toll with approximately 444,333 
casualties within the specified time period. Continental Asia also saw the highest number of
armed conflict events in proportion to other regions while Europe saw the lowest number 
of armed conflicts globally. North and South America saw the lowest death
toll relative to other regions and the second lowest percentage of armed conflicts relative
to the rest of the world.
